You can connect signals to themselves whilst also being connected to another node. This is good for the Single Responsibility design principle as scripts are
only doing one thing.
    - E.g. You can have a text field signal upwards that the text has been entered whilst also signaling to yourself that you want to clear the text field.

When you need to get refferences to child nodes via variables (onready var = $...) ask yourself how many times you need to use that variable, if you don't need
to use them that often not create the variables and instead use a function to change the child nodes.

Formatted strings are pretty broken, useful for when trying to return text with certain words that only variables carry.
    - E.g "Stats: Health: %i Race %s" [health, race]
